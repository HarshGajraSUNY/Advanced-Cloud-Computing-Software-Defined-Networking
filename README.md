# Advanced-Cloud-Computing-Software-Defined-Networking

Software defined Networking (Python)

We play with software-defined (SDN) networking techniques and get familiar with 
the main concepts of SDN. 
We will use Mininet to create an emulation platform with the software-based
OpenFlow switches (i.e., Open vSwitch).
On top of this emulated SDN platform, POX is used as the SDN
controller. We need to correctly deploy the emulation platform and SDN controller, be familiar with the
operations, program SDN controllers, and finish the required tasks. 
After these tasks, we should have a
concrete idea on how SDN controller communicates with OpenFlow switches.
